## Assumptions

### Database models

#### Spaceships

| column name | data type | note                                                         | Description               |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| status      | string    | can only be 1 of ['decommissioned', 'operational', 'maintenance'] | the status of spaceship   |
| name        | string    | cannot be null, user must supply when adding new ship        | the name of spaceship     |
| model       | string    | cannot be null, user must supply when adding new ship        | the model of spaceship    |
| id          | integer   | generated by the db,  with auto-increment                    | the id of spaceship       |
| location    | integer   | a foreign key referring to *locations.id*, can be null as db can have no *location* at all | the location of spaceship |





#### Locations

| column name | data type | note                                                         |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id          | integer   | generated by the db,  with auto-increment, user does not need to supply when adding a new location |
| city        | string    | can be null, as a *location* can mean an entire planet       |
| planet      | string    | cannot be null, user must supply when adding a new ship      |
| capacity    | integer   | must be equal or greater than 0, user must supply when adding a new location |
| stationed   | integer   | must be greater or equal than 0, must be less or equal than *capacity*; updated when a spaceship travels; equals to 0 when first added |

**Comment** all *id*s  uniquely identify a data entry for its entire existence, Even if the entry is removed, the *id* cannot be reused for any new entry.



### API Routes

| HTTP route                   | HTTP method | Given                                                        | Returned HTTP code                                           | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /add_ship                    | POST        | ship_name (str), model (str), location (int), status (str)   | **406** if given empty value for required data; **406** if *ship_name* is used;  **404** is *location* does not exist; **403** if *location* is full in capacity | Given the data of a new spaceship, add a new row into the database and return a message indicating successful registration |
| /remove_ship/\<int:sid\>     | DELETE      | ship_id (int)                                                | **404** if the ship with *ship_id* not found in the database | Remove a row from the database, update the number of spaceship at the location the spaceship was previously and return a message indicating successful removal |
| /update_ship_status          | PUT         | ship_id (int), status (str)                                  | **406** if given invalid data; **404** if spaceship with given *ship_id* not found in database; **406** if the spaceship is in *status* already | Update the 'status' column of entry with the given *ship_id*, return a message indicating successful update |
| /add_location                | POST        | city_name (str, nullable), planet_name (str), capacity (int) | **406** if receive invalid data; **406** if a location with the same *city_name* and *planet_name* already exists in the database | Add a spaceship data entry with the given data to the database and return a message indicating successful registration |
| /remove_location/\<int:lid\> | DELETE      | location_id (int)                                            | **404** if location with given *location_id* not found in the database; **403** if there are spaceship at the location needed to be removed | Delete a location data entry with given *location_id* from the database, return a message indicating successful removal |
| /travel/\<int:destination\>  | PUT         | destination_id (int), ship_id (int)                          | **404** if location with *destination_id*  or location with *destination_id* not found in the database; **403** if spaceship with *ship_id* is not in 'operational' status; **406** if spaceship with *ship_id* is already at *destination_id*; **403** if *destination* cannot accommodate any more spaceship | Update the 'location' column of the spaceship entry with *ship_id*, update 'stationed' column of *destination* and *origin*, return a message indicating successful update |
