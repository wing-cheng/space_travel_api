## Assumptions

### Database models

#### Spaceships

| column name | data type | note                                                         |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| status      | string    | can only be 1 of ['decommissioned', 'operational', 'maintenance'] |
| name        | string    | cannot be null, user must supply when adding new ship        |
| model       | string    | cannot be null, user must supply when adding new ship        |
| id          | integer   | generated by the db,  with auto-increment                    |
| location    | integer   | a foreign key referring to *locations.id*, can be null as db can have no *location* at all |

#### Locations

| column name | data type | note                                                         |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id          | integer   | generated by the db,  with auto-increment, user does not need to supply when adding a new location |
| city        | string    | can be null, as a *location* can mean an entire planet       |
| planet      | string    | cannot be null, user must supply when adding a new ship      |
| capacity    | integer   | must be equal or greater than 0, user must supply when adding a new location |
| stationed   | integer   | must be greater or equal than 0, must be less or equal than *capacity*; updated when a spaceship travels; equals to 0 when first added |
